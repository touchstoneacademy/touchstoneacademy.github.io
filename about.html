      <p>
        Touchstone Academy is a unique educational initiative undertaken by us - a few NITC alumni, for the welfare of students of our college. As Alumni, we have experienced the requirements of students on a first hand basis. The students, in order to become successful, must possess overall competencies - Technical and Managerial, Soft skills, good aptitude and a positive attitude towards life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our experience has shown that even though all students have sufficient Technical skills, their competencies in other critical areas (as mentioned above) are acutely short. Towards this end Touchstone academy will compensate for the offset.
      </p>
      <p>
        Touchstone is an academy where students can avail the following facilities :
        <ul style="font-size: 80%; margin-left: 30px;">
          <li><b>Placement training</b> - with special features of Corporate Exposure, Career guidance and Industry experience.</li>
          <li><b>Regular interactions and guidance sessions</b> from Successful professionals across the broad spectrum of professions. A dedicated one-to-one mentoring system for intensive coaching.</li>
          <li>A comprehensive professional and personal <b>ethics and value based training</b> - for overall development of personality and character.</li>
          <li><b>Soft skills</b> such as Communication skills, <b>Leadership training</b> and specific management sessions - suitably packaged for the students for equipping themselves adequately.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Touchstone is aimed at supplementing the efforts of college - to advance the students from - better to the best and from worst to good!
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, with our professional experience and corporate exposure, we can deliver the practical best to our students and we have that confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope and believe that our venture is an immense value addition to the students and the institution.
